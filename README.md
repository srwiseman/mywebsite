# Intro

This is my personal website. It's built entirely with ReactJS, HTML, and CSS.

See it in action here: [stephenwiseman.ca](http://stephenwiseman.ca)

# Development

To get started, clone this repo. Then do a:
```bash
npm install
```

Then:
```bash
npm start
```

If you want to deploy it in production, do a:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/webpack -p
```

Then serve the contents of the `public` directory.
